/// within `seconds`, the operation's Task is cancelled and `TimeoutError` is thrown.

/// Uses unstructured tasks so the caller is NOT blocked waiting for a stuck
/// operation to respond to cancellation (e.g., NIO TCP connect, raw continuations).
/// The cancelled operation task is abandoned — it will clean up when it eventually
/// finishes or when the process exits.
///
/// - Important: The operation should check `Task.isCancelled` or use
///   `try Task.checkCancellation()` at `await` points to respond to cancellation promptly.
