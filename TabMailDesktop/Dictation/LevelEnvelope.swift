/// Adapts the waveform to the range of sound coming in, so it follows the voice on any
/// microphone: two exponential-moving-average envelopes of the loudness (dB). The floor follows
/// quieter readings fast and louder ones slowly; the peak follows louder readings fast and
/// quieter ones slowly. Each reading shows where it sits between them.
///
/// Warm-up: a moving average starts out anchored to its first readings (a start-up blip could
/// hold the floor down for seconds). Each weight is therefore at least 1/n for the n-th reading,
/// making the envelopes plain running averages while few readings exist; the window grows until
/// the EMA's own weight takes over (n = 1/alpha, ≈ 4 s for the slow side).
