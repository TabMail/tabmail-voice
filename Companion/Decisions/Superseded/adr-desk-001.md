## ADR-DESK-001: Native Swift menu-bar app, on-device speech recognition

> ⛔ **Speech-recognition half SUPERSEDED by ADR-DESK-005 (owner 2026-09-24).** The native Swift menu-bar app stands; on-device `SpeechAnalyzer` was removed in favor of backend STT so all platforms share one engine. Kept for history.

> ⛔ **Native-Swift half SUPERSEDED by ADR-DESK-032 (owner 2026-09-27):** one Electron app for macOS, Windows and Linux replaces the Swift app; `apps/macos/` was removed 2026-09-27 (ADR-DESK-032's cutover amendment). Kept for history.

**Context:** Phase 1 replaces Wispr Flow for basic system-wide dictation. Options: Electron/Tauri
(cross-platform) or native Swift; cloud STT (Groq Whisper via the backend) or on-device.

**Decision:** Native Swift/SwiftUI menu-bar app (`LSUIElement`), macOS 26+. Speech is transcribed
on-device with `SpeechAnalyzer` + `DictationTranscriber` (`.progressiveLongDictation`, punctuated).

**Rationale:** Global hotkeys, Accessibility, keystroke posting and audio are all first-class in
AppKit; the team already ships Swift (iOS) and can share code in phase 4. On-device STT costs
nothing per minute, needs no account, sends no audio anywhere (ADR-004 by construction), and
`AnalysisContext.contextualStrings` gives phase 2 a private way to bias recognition towards names
from mail and calendar. Verified end-to-end by `SpeechTranscriptionSessionTests`.

**Consequences:**
- macOS only; Windows would be a separate client.
- Accuracy is Apple's model's. If it proves insufficient against Wispr Flow, a server STT
  endpoint (Groq `whisper-large-v3-turbo` through the TabMail backend) is the escalation. That
  sends audio off-device, so it's the owner's call.
- First use of a language downloads its model (`AssetInventory`); the app does this at launch.
